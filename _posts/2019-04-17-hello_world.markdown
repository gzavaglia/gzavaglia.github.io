I took a total of three programming classes while I was in college: Basic, C++ & Java. Every class starts the same, posting the "Hello World" message; so I figured since this is the first blog I would like to say Hello (blog) World in my own way. 

So HELLO WORLD! My name is Giovana, but everyone calls me Gio. I'm 30 years old, and I was born in Argentina. I moved to the US to study Electrical Engineering in 2012. A little secret about Electrical Engineers: we're all kinda scared about programming. 

Since Computer and Electrical engineering go together in most curriculums, everyone thinks that we would share the same interests. And we kind of do. The main difference: we, as Electricals, are really scared about "talking" to the computer. I was required to take a couple of programming classes back in college and I was always feeling dumb and falling behind... The problem was I never had really good teachers. Now, little by little, I'm getting rid of all my fears about this career, and thanks to the support from Flatiron, I feel so confident about my skills, more than I've ever had!

I'm very excited to continue this journey and hopefully prove myself wrong
