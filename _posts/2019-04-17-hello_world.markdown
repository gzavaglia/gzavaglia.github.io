I took a total of three programming classes while I was in college: Basic, C++ & Java. Every class starts the same, posting the "Hello World" message; so I figured since this is the first blog I would like to say Hello (blog) World in my own way. 

So HELLO WORLD! My name is Giovana, but everyone calls me Gio. I'm 30 years old, and I was born in Argentina. I moved to the US to study Electrical Engineering in 2012. A little secret about Electrical Engineers: we're all kinda scared about programming. I was required to take a couple of programming classes back in college and I was always feeling behind and dumb... The problem was I never had really good teachers. Now, little by little, I'm getting rid of all my fears about this career, and thanks to the support from Flatiron, I feel so confident about my skills, more than I've ever had!

I'm very excited to continue this journey and to tell y'all more about it!
